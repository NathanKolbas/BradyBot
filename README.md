# BradyBot

## About
The BradyBot was developed by Nathan Kolbas and is currently in use in our software engineering Discord server. It is mainly used for jokes and memes but can become much more. It was originally built with node.js but migrated over to python before release. 

## Features
The BradyBot's main feature is the ability to @ any user in the Discord which will then take their profile image and overlay it onto an Among Us gif. The overlaid image is also moving each frame. More features to be added in the future such as reading a random Brady quote or adding a new one.
